# Reservoir compaction modeling

Simulate reservoir compaction due to pore-pressure changes by integrating the
solution proposed by Tempone et al. (2010) on the volume of rectangular cells.
This strategy is similar to that proposed by Muñoz and Roehl (2017). The
difference here is that we solve the volume integrals according to
Nagy et al. (2000) and Nagy et al. (2002).
